/network/service API

The registration of a service in the network takes four steps:
1: Create a Service CA key/cert and request signature by the Network Services
   CA via a POST /api/v1/network/service request.
2: Register the service and its data cert using a
   PUT /api/v1/network/service/{service_id} request.
3: Submit the service-signed schema for the service and get it signed by
   the network using the PATCH /api/v1/network/service request.
4: Download the fully signed schema and publish it on the web site for the
   service using the GET /api/v1/network/service request.
