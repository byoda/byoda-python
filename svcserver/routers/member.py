/network/member API

It takes 3 steps for a pod to become a member of service:
1: POST service/api/v1/service/member to get a CSR for a membersigned
2: PUT directory/api/v1/service/member to get the DNS record created
3: PUT service/api/v1/service/member to tell service that the pod with
   the membership is up and running
