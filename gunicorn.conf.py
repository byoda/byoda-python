'''
Gunicorn acts as process manager for uvicorn. Gunicorn does not support ASGI,
uvicorn does

Supported environment variables:
  - WORKERS: number of processes to be launched by gunicorn, defaults to 2.
    Setting it to 0 will cause workers to be launched based on the number of
    cores in the pod
