## The 'local' directory needs to have several secrets in order to run various test cases

The VS Code definition for the 'file_storage_test' test case defines:
"GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS": "tests/collateral/local/gcp-sa-byoda-storage.json"

Also required are
tests/collateral/local/azure-pod-member-cert.pem
tests/collateral/local/azure-pod-member.key
