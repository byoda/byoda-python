# Creating a service

There are 4 phases/steps to set up a service

## 1: Install required software
Install nginx as reverse proxy as per the [instructions of F5/Nginx](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-open-source/)

Then install the nginx.conf file
```
sudo cp docs/files/nginx-service.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
sudo nginx -s reload
```

Services typically need to store data about their members. With Byoda, services are not allowed to persist data about their members but are allowed to cache that data. The reference implementation of the service server uses Redis to temporarily store information as Redis can automatically remove expired data.

To install Redis, first install docker as per the [Docker instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and then launch the redis container.
```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/redis/config
sudo docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \
    -p 6379:6379 \
    -v /opt/redis/config:/usr/local/etc/redis \
    --name redis redis:latest
```

You can review the configuration in /opt/redis/config/redis.conf for any changes that may be needed

## 2: Pick a value for the service ID

Each service must have a unique integer value for the SERVICE_ID. Here are the rules to the values:
- 0: reserved for the 'private' service that each network must support
- 1 <= value < 16384 : do not use, only standard services that each network must support can use these values
- 16384 <= value < 2**32-2**16 : service contracts with these values are subject to both automated and manual review (note, manual review is not yet implemented).
- 2**32-2**16 <= value < 2**32: These are values for testing services. Any registration of a service with a service_id not currently in use will be approved after an automated review. Any service registered with one of these values is subject to deletion at any given time (for example first day of each month) so you may have to re-register your service periodically. Clients must explicitly acknowledge that they want to become member of a service with a service_id in this range before the membership is established. Any assigned service_ids from this range are ephemeral. Periodically, all allocations from this range are reset. The directory server will wipe any DNS records and certs for services using this range. You will need to resubmit the JSON file and there is no guarantee you can re-use the same service_id. Clients will have to re-join your service with the new service_id

You can see what services are currently using what Service IDs you can call the network/nervices API, ie.

```
export BYODA_NETWORK=byoda.net
curl https://dir.${BYODA_NETWORK}/api/v1/network/services
```
Note that this API uses pagination so you may have to use the 'skip=<n>' query parameter to iterate over all services

## 3: Developing the schema

### The JSON file
The schema is a JSON file with a JSON Schema embedded. We have not yet published a JSON Schema for this JSON file.

The JSON file at the top-level must have the following keys:
|--------------|--------|----------|
| description  | string | A description of your service |
| name         | string | The name of your service |
| owner        | string | Your name of the name of the company you create the service for |
| supportemail | string | Email address where a person can request support for a service |
| website      | string | The URL to your website |
| service_id   | integer| the service ID for your service. As discussed in section #2 |
| version      | integer| the version of the schema. See below on versioning|
| signatures   | object | a JSON object, see section 5 on the signing of the JSON file
| jsonschema   | jsonschema | the JSON Schema for the data for the service|
|--------------|--------|----------|

We use the python [fastjsonschema](https://horejsek.github.io/python-fastjsonschema/) module for validating data against the JSON Schema, which states support for JSON Schema draft 4, 5, and 7.
We do not support the full specification of JSON Schema for the translation to the GraphQL API. The JSON file for the addressbook schema can be used as a starting point for creating a new schema. Specifically, we know
of the following support:
- At the root level of the schema, we support the following keys:
  - $id: must be a string with value: "https://<service-UUID>.services.byoda.net/service/<name of your service>. The name of your service must match the "name" field at the top level of the schema. The service-UUID must match the UUID assigned to your service.
  - $schema: Must be set to "https://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"
  - $defs: one or more definitions of a data object, see below
  - title: must match the "name" field at the top level of the schema
  - description: must match the "description" field at the top level of the schema
  - type: must be "object"
  - properties: see below

### Versioning
The integer value for the version key the JSON file must be 1 or higher. When you submit the JSON file to the directory server, the version must be increased by 1 from the previously successfully submitted JSON file. Submitting a JSON file to get the network signature for the schema with the version unchanged from a previous successful request will fail.

### Data objects
The keys of properties directly under the JSON Schema (so not under $defs) must be the name of classes and the keys for each class must be:
  - description: What the data stored in this class is used for
  - type: must be "object" or "array"
  - #accesscontrol: a dict with the specification of who has access to the data stored in instances of the class. See the section on access control below for more information

If the type is "object" then it must have a key "properties with as value an object with the keys:
  - description: What the data stored in this property is used for
  - #accesscontrol: see below for more information
  - type: must be a scalar, (ie. "string" or "number")
  - format: any value for this key is used for data validation but is not translated into the GraphQL API

IF the type is "array" then the following keys are required:
  - description: What the data stored in this property is used for
  - #accesscontrol: see below for more information
  - items: must be an object with a key with one of these two values:
    - type: must be "string" or "integer"
    - $ref: a string that must match one of the classes defined under $defs (see below)

A data structure under $defs must have the following keys:
- $id: string with "/schemas/<class-name>"
- $schema: Must be set to "https://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"
- description: What the data stored in this class is used for
- type: must be "object"
- properties: must be a dict with keys the different properties of the class. Each property must have keys:
  - description: What the data stored in this property is used for
  - type: must be a scalar, ie. "string" or "number"
  - format: any value for this key is used for data validation but is not translated into the GraphQL API

A class directly under the root of the JSON Schema or in the $defs object can not have any of the following names:
- member
- network
- memberlogs

### Data Access control
The GraphQL API will be secured using credentials. Credentials have a type of one of:
  - member: You, as owner of the pod that created the membership
  - service: the service that you joined
  - network: soneone that you have a relation with in your network for the service. This field can have a specifier in the form of "network:<relation>". In that case, only people in your network with that type of relation will have to described access to the data.

  Access permissions are hierarchical. By default, you as member have READ access to all data defined in the JSON Schema. For objects lower in the hierarchy, permissions can be defined as well and those permissions (and only those permissions) will be enforced for that data element and all data elements under it. The data hierarchy will be traversed and the final access specification for a data element defines if access to that data element is granted or not.

  The permissions are:
  - READ. The read permission can have a caching specifier like "READ:8h" or "READ:1d" that specifies how long the data may be cached by a service or other pod after reading the information. When data is cached by a service or pod, it may not persist the data to permanent storage but must key the data in ephemeral memory with automatic expiration and cache ejection after the specified time.
  - UPDATE
  - APPEND
  - DELETE
  - SEARCH. The SEARCH permission can have a specifier like "SEARCH:excact-casesensitive" that specifies what type of search is permitted.

## 4: Create the secrets for a service

Each service has the following secrets:
- ServiceCA: signed by the Network Services CA, which s operated by the network
- Service: The TLS secret used both for the web server and as client TLS cert for outbound connections
- AppsCA: signed by the Service CA, used to sign secrets for 'apps' supported by the service. (but 'Apps' are currently not yet implemented/supported)
- MembersCA: signed by the Service CA, signs Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) from pods that want to join the service using the POST /api/v1/service/member API
- ServiceData: Signed by the Service CA. This is the secret used to sign documents, such as the service schema/data contract so that others can verify its authenticity

We create the service secrets using the 'tools/create_service_secrets.py' script. It is best practice to create and store the ServiceCA secret on an off-line server. _*Make sure to carefully review the output of the script as it contains the password needed to decrypt the private key for the Service CA*_. You need to save this password in a password manager and you may need it in the future when your service secrets expire and need to be re-generated!

```
export BYODA_HOME=/opt/byoda
export BYODA_DOMAIN=byoda.net

export SERVICE_CONTRACT=<service contract file>
cp $SERVICE_CONTRACT $BYODA_HOME/
sudo apt install moreutils      # for the 'sponge' tool that we use on the next line
 jq --arg service_id "$SERVICE_ID" '.service_id = $service_id' ${BYODA_HOME}/${SERVICE_CONTRACT} | sponge ${BYODA_HOME}/${SERVICE_CONTRACT}

# Here we update the 'service_id' in the service schema to match a newly generated random service ID
export SERVICE_ID=$( python3 -c 'import random; print(pow(2,32)-random.randint(1,pow(2,16)))')

export SERVICE_DIR="${BYODA_HOME}/service-${SERVICE_ID}"
sudo mkdir -p ${SERVICE_DIR}
sudo chown -R ${USER}:${USER} ${BYODA_HOME}
cd ${BYODA_HOME}
git clone https://github.com/StevenHessing/byoda-python
cd byoda-python
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)
sudo pip3 install passgen
PASSWORD=$(passgen -n 1 -l 48)
echo "Passwords for service secrets except the Service CA: ${PASSWORD}"
tools/create_service_secrets.py --debug --schema ${SERVICE_CONTRACT} --network ${BYODA_DOMAIN} --root-directory ${SERVICE_DIR} --password ${PASSWORD} 2>&1 | tee /tmp/service.log

```

Make sure you securely store the passwords for the ServiceCA and the password for the other secrets, for example in a password manager.
Now you can copy all secrets except the private key of the ServiceCA to the server you want to host the service.
```
SERVER_IP=<IP address of your server>

ssh ${SERVER_IP} "sudo mkdir -p ${SERVICE_DIR}; sudo chown -R ${USER}:${USER} ${BYODA_HOME}"
cd ${BYODA_HOME}
scp -r * ${SERVER_IP}:${BYODA_HOME}
ssh ${SERVER_IP} "rm ${SERVICE_DIR}/private/network-${BYODA_NETWORK}-service-${SERVICE_ID}-service-ca.key
```

## 5: Signing your schema

There are two signatures for a schema: the ServiceData secret provides the 'service' signature and the NetworkServicesCA provides the 'network' signature.

As you just created the ServiceData secret in step #2, you can generate the service signature but you'll have to ask the directory server of the network to provide the network signature by calling the PATCH /api/v1/network/service API. Both steps are implemented by the '[tools/sign_data_contract.py](https://github.com/StevenHessing/byoda-python/blob/master/tools/sign_data_contract.py)' script.

```
export BYODA_HOME=/opt/byoda
export BYODA_DOMAIN=byoda.net

export 3=private.json

export SERVICE_ID=$(jq -r .service_id ${BYODA_HOME}/${SERVICE_CONTRACT})
export SERVICE_DIR="${BYODA_HOME}/service-${SERVICE_ID}"

cd ${BYODA_HOME}/byoda-python
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)
tools/sign_data_contract.py --debug --contract ${SERVICE_CONTRACT} --network ${BYODA_DOMAIN} --root-directory ${SERVICE_DIR} --password=${PASSWORD}

## 5: Get the service up and running

NGINX_USER=www-data
sudo chown -R ${NGINX_USER}:${NGINX_USER} ${SERVICE_DIR}/network-*
```

The service daemon will create an Nginx configuration file under /etc/nginx/conf.d
and make nginx load that new configuration.

To test the service certificate signed by the root CA of the network, you can use openssl and/or curl:
```
openssl s_client -connect service.service-0.byoda.net:443 -CAfile root-ca.pem

curl  https://service.service-0.byoda.net/network-byoda.net-service-0-data-cert.pem -o network-byoda.net-service-0-data-cert.pem --cacert root-ca.pem
```

### Developing the service
The reference svcserver and the svcworker implement a pattern where the svcserver writes a member UUID to a Redis key whenever a pod registers the membership with the svcserver. The Redis key has a list as its value. The svcworker periodically takes a member UUID from the head of the list and pushes it to the back of the list. The svcworker can then query data from the pod of that member and store any data listed as cachable in the service contract in Redis
